#guidking.api

The *guidking.api* will expose an endpoint to generate GUID(s). It also captures a small amount of metric data that is stored in a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance. A websocket is used to update a system lifetime count of GUIDs generated.

To get started developing on the *guidking.api* open up a terminal and run:

`npm install && npm run dev`

## Routes

* `/?amount={n}` where {n} equals the number of guids to return
* `/total` total number of guids generated by the system

## Unit Tests

Unit test can be ran with the following:

`npm test`

## Production

To prepare a production ready docker image:

`npm run build:prod`
